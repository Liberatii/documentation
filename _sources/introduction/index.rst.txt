Introduction
============
Welcome to the Liberatii Data Platform documentation, your resource for understanding our solution to database virtualization and migration.

Liberatii Data Platform focuses on simplifying database migration tasks and challenges. This guide introduces you to its structure, primary components, and how it all works together. We've added links for you to dive deeper into topics when you need more detail.

The Liberatii Data Platform is built on three main components:

**1. Database Migration Assessment Tool:** A tool designed to evaluate Oracle databases in preparation for migration, ensuring they align with the Liberatii platform.

**2. Liberatii Database Migration Engine:** Equipped with a REST API, this engine manages various aspects of the migration process, from data transfer to verification and more.

**3. Liberatii Gateway:** This is the central part of our platform. Acting as a real-time SQL translation engine, it's vital for database virtualization and helps shift applications smoothly to new cloud databases.

Knowing how these components interact is key to getting the most out of the Liberatii Data Platform.

As you go through this guide, you'll find:

- **Concepts:** Introducing the basics of the Liberatii Data Platform, including details on the Liberatii Gateway and Database Migration Engine, and an overview of the migration journey.

- **Pre-migration:** Highlighting the steps taken before the actual migration, with a special focus on the assessment phase.

- **Migration:** Walking you through the migration steps, from moving schema to data migration and more.

- **Post-migration:** Covering actions to take after migration, such as monitoring and tuning.

- **References:** For those looking for technical depth, this is where developers and DBAs can learn more about the ins and outs of the Liberatii Data Platform.

It's best to go through the guide from start to finish to get a complete picture.
